Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a Unity motion matching toolkit, and contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, bug fixes, new features, documentation, and tests.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Open the project with Unity 6000.3 or later.

## Development workflow

- Create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change when possible.
- Follow the existing code style used in `Packages/com.nekuzaky.kinema`.

```

3. Link any related issues.
